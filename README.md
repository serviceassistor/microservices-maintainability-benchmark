# Maintainability Benchmark of Microservices

This repo contains a maintainability benchmark of open source Microservices based on expert ratings. You will find three things in here:

- A [rating scheme](rating-scheme.xlsx) with all relevant properties
- A [guide](rating-scheme-guide.md) explaining how to use the rating scheme
- A [one-pager](system-one-pagers/README.md) for each system that should be analyzed

## Suggested Study Process

1. Carefully read the [rating guide](rating-scheme-guide.md), then download and examine the [rating scheme](https://github.com/xJREB/microservices-maintainability-benchmark/raw/master/rating-scheme.xlsx).
2. While keeping the schema in mind, analyze each system.
   - Read the one-pager of the system.
   - Navigate to the GitHub repository of the system and analyze its contents. You can also download the repo to your machine to ease browsing.
   - Create a preliminary rating for the system based on your analysis. Provide comments for your rationale, if appropriate.
3. After analyzing all systems, refine the preliminary ratings based on your newly-gained insights.
4. Fill in the demographic data in the second tab of the rating scheme.
5. Send the filled out rating scheme back to us via email.
